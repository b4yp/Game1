# Game 1
The Game of Your Life!

"Game 1" started off as a QBasic program back in the late 80s, written by myself and @astrosteve. It had a little song at the beginning consisting of single notes through the PC speaker followed by a quick game where you basically try to go through a door and if you guess wrong, you die. 

We created newer "Games" (up to 6, I think) which had the same basic gameplay with different themes. All got lost over time, but I've re-programmed "Game 1" as a programming exercise now and then as it's fairly simple and should be programmable in every language.

At this point, "Game 1" has been written in QBasic, QB64, FORTRAN, C, Go, and even DCL! 

Who knows, maybe it'll be written in even more languages in the future!

Anyone who wants to submit other versions of "Game 1" are more than welcome!
